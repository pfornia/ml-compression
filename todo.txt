Lit review
    Is "connect the dots" step actually novel?

2) Compression metrics
    See pg 7 of theis:
    Mean Squared Error
    PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio, see wikipedia), 
    SSIM, MS-SSIM

3) Study CAE architecture

Quantize encoded output

Validation set metrics in tf

figure out how to re-randomize top layers in alternation; may help avoid local optima
    Or. Maybe 
        1) freeze bottom layers 
        2) randomize top 
        3) optimize top 
        4) unfreeze and retrain entire network.

Get other datasets
    Street view addresses
    Faces
    CIFAR-10?? This is color, but dimension looks good
    For now:
        MNIST
        KMNIST
        fashion MNIST


Batch Normalization, not CNN dropout

Dropout should not be affecting inference, i.e., inference should be deterministic!

Make AE better! Still seems to underperform tf version.

Double check that compress layers are actually getting frozen by .detach().
    Need to capture consistent set of images
